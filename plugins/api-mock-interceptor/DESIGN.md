- Save/load mock scenarios for different testing contexts
- Auto-generate TypeScript interfaces from responses
- GraphQL and REST API support
- Response validation against OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas
- Diff view between original and mocked responses

## Technical Implementation
- Intercept fetch/XMLHttpRequest at runtime
- Service Worker for advanced interception
