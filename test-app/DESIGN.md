# Browser Automation & Test Recorder - Design Document

## Purpose
Built-in E2E test automation directly in DevTools - record, playback, and generate tests

## Core Features

### Recording Capabilities
- Click, type, and navigation recording
- Hover and drag interaction capture
- Scroll position tracking
- File upload recording
- Iframe interaction support
- Shadow DOM element recording
- Multi-tab workflow recording

### Smart Selectors
- Multiple selector strategies (CSS, XPath, text, test-id)
- Selector stability scoring
- Auto-healing selectors when DOM changes
- Visual element picker with highlighting
- Accessibility selector preferences (ARIA, role)

### Playback Engine
- Step-by-step execution with pause/resume
- Variable speed playback
- Conditional waits and assertions
- Screenshot capture at each step
- Network request mocking during playback
- Cross-browser execution (via Playwright)

### Code Generation
- Export to Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer
- Multiple language support (JS, TS, Python, C#)
- Page Object Model generation
- Custom framework templates
- Assertion generation from recordings

### Advanced Features
- Visual regression testing with pixel diff
- API call verification during tests
- Test data parameterization
- Parallel test execution
- CI/CD integration scripts
- Test failure debugging with DOM snapshots
- Performance metrics during tests
- Accessibility assertions

### Collaboration
- Share recordings via URL
- Team test library
- Comments on test steps
- Test review workflow

## Technical Implementation
- Chrome DevTools Protocol integration
- MutationObserver for DOM tracking
- Playwright/Puppeteer core for execution
- WebDriver BiDi for cross-browser support
- Local test runner with live reload
- Cloud execution options

## Unique DevTools Advantages
- Zero installation - runs in browser
- Access to all DevTools data (network, console, performance)
- Real-time DOM inspection during recording
- Integrated with other DevTools plugins (API mocking, etc.)
- Browser-native performance
